# Face-Mask-Detector
 This is my sixth semester's project.I have tried to build Face Mask Detector using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Python, Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCV. With further improvements these types of models could be integrated with CCTV or other types cameras to detect and identify people without masks. With the prevailing worldwide situation due to COVID-19 pandemic, these types of systems would be very supportive for many kind of institutions around the world. I have used the dataset created by Prajna Bhandary which is available in Github.
